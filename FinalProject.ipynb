    "We want to shed light on the effects of economic inequality on society, and see if it has any effect on crime rates. We can tackle this topic from a data science perspective by narrowing down the question a bit more. The data science question we are asking is the following:  What is the correlation between street crime and economic inequality in the US? \n",
    "    \n",
    "There are some important things to note about how we defined our terms. Firstly, the kind of crime we are looking at includes forms of violent crime and street crime - things like muggings, theft, and perhaps even murder. We are not currently interested in things like speeding or white collar crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we are looking at economic inequality, not poverty. While it is fairly obvious that poverty and crime are related (with desperation comes drastic measures), we are trying to tease out the effect of income inequality in and of itself. It could be that inequality contributes to the disintegration of communities and crime in a fashion that is independent from the sheer effect of poverty.  Perhaps one community might have more crime in it than another even though they both have similar levels of poverty, due to the fact that the one community has a substantial level of inequality. Indeed, it’s possible that an unequally distributed increase in wealth could catalyze an upswing in crime. This will no doubt require close inspection to properly disambiguate the effects of poverty from the effects of inequality."

    "Due to developments in our current political climate, discussion about the harms of income inequality has become increasingly prevalent. Popular politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders have shined the floodlights on the glaring cleft that lies between the richest Americans and the rest of us.  A quick look at the numbers will show that the divide between rich and poor is growing in this country (1). With the advent of this apparent fact, many have begun researching the various ways in which increased income inequality affects society. \n",
    "\n",
    "We’re not the first group of people  to investigate the relationship between crime and income inequality. According to David Luther from Zippia, in 2016, the FBI released crime rate statistics that showed correlation between city crime and income inequality (2). The study looks at FBI data about property crime and violent crime and concluded that income inequality correlates the strongest with crime compared to other variables such as unemployment, poverty, and number of high school graduates where there was only weak correlation. In this paper, the results also show that robbery and burglary in the US are strongly affected by income inequality (3). On a larger scale, this journal article also describes how violent crime and income inequality are positively correlated when looking at different countries (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add something of value to the larger conversation by getting a better idea of exactly what kinds of crime interact with economic inequality. Rather than look at an aggregate of property and violent crimes, we want to look at the specific types of crimes that might correlate with income inequality in the United States. Types of crime we are interested in investigating include assault, robbery, arson, rape, and hate crimes. In terms of income inequality, we can also look at the different types of ways that income inequality is measured to give more context to our findings. For instance, looking at the mean, median, and standard deviation of income for each location and taking into account the state Gini index (discussed more in the Data section below).\n",

    "We expect to find a positive correlation between the rate of street crime and economic inequality in the US. There are news articles all over the internet that speculate about this particular correlation. It is a relationship that governments, organizations, economists, and sociologists have all studied a fair amount. In particular, as stated in the NYU Dispatch’s article “How big is income inequality as a determinant of crime rates?” from May 23, 2018, “[a] 2002 study by The World Bank found that crime rates and inequality are positively correlated, and an increase in income inequality has the effect of intensely increasing crime rates.”"

    "Some ethical issues we may need to consider would include the disclosure of data of minors, for example the perpetrator of a juvenile crime. Perhaps we can use data where crimes of minors are included as long as identities are anonymous or unknown. Otherwise, we could focus our project solely on the crimes performed by persons of legal age, thus removing information about minors from our datasets. All of the data sets we have looked at right now are public datasets, so we should be fine as far as permissions are concerned. Any identifying information have already been redacted to maintain confidentiality. In terms of bias, there could be bias in the crime reporting and data that we are looking at since it is collected by humans. We also have to be aware of the bias and cultural issues around reporting certain crimes such as rape or hate crimes."
